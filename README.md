# o1x

## Git agreements:

- Branch name should include current date, i.e "_update-router-29-09-2025_"

## General info

- Use tailwind as much as it's possible
- Use router only programmatically (via _router.push()_ instead of _router-link_)
- Use i18n for the translations and don't forget to update both en.json and ua.json
